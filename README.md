A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.
# Task 1:
## Declare a variable named "number" and assign it a given integer value. Write a Dart program to check whether the number is positive or negative using if-else statements. Print "The number is positive" if it's greater than 0, and "The number is negative" otherwise.
# Task 2:
## Declare a variable named "year" and assign it a given integer value. Create a Dart program to determine if the year is a leap year or not using if-else statements. Print "It's a leap year" if the year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or if it's divisible by 400. Otherwise, print "It's not a leap year."
# Task 3:
## Declare a variable named "number" and assign it a given integer value. Write a Dart program to check if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 using if-else statements. Print "The number is divisible by 2 and 3" if it's divisible by both, and "The number is not divisible by 2 and 3" otherwise.
# Task 4:
## Declare two variables named "a" and "b" and assign them given integer values. Create a Dart program to find the maximum of the two numbers using if-else statements. Print the maximum value.
# Task 5:
## Declare a variable named "age" and assign it a given integer value. Write a Dart program to check if a person is eligible to vote or not based on their age using if-else statements. Print "You are eligible to vote" if the age is 18 or above, and "You are not eligible to vote" otherwise.
# Task 6:
## Declare a variable named "marks" and assign it a given integer value. Create a Dart program to calculate the grade of a student based on their marks using if-else statements. Print "Grade A" if the marks are 90 or above, "Grade B" if they are between 80 and 89, "Grade C" if they are between 70 and 79, and "Grade F" otherwise.
# Task 7:
## Declare a variable named "character" and assign it a given character value. Write a Dart program to check if the character is a vowel or a consonant using if-else statements. Print "It's a vowel" if the character is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u', and "It's a consonant" otherwise.
# Task 8:
## Declare three variables named "num1", "num2", and "num3" and assign them given integer values. Create a Dart program to determine the largest number among the three given numbers using if-else statements. Print the largest number.
# Task 9:
## Declare a variable named "number" and assign it a given integer value. Write a Dart program to check if the number is even or odd using if-else statements. Print "The number is even" if it's divisible by 2, and "The number is odd" otherwise.
# Task 10:
## Declare a variable named "year" and assign it a given integer value representing a year. Create a Dart program to determine if the year is a century year or not (ending with '00') using if-else statements. Print "It's a century year" if the year is divisible by 100, and "It's not a century year" otherwise.
