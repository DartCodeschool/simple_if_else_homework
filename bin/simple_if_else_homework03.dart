//Task 3:
//Declare a variable named "number" and assign it a given integer value. Write a Dart program to check if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3 using if-else statements. Print "The number is divisible by 2 and 3" if it's divisible by both, and "The number is not divisible by 2 and 3" otherwise.
