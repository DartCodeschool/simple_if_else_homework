//Task 2:
//Declare a variable named "year" and assign it a given integer value. Create a Dart program to determine if the year is a leap year or not using if-else statements. Print "It's a leap year" if the year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or if it's divisible by 400. Otherwise, print "It's not a leap year."
